# Iterables
# # Iterables = An object/collection that can return its elements one at a time.
#                allowing it to be iterated over in a loop


# Lists can be reversed
# Sets can't be reversed
# Tuple can be reversed

# List
# fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "strawberry", "blueberry" "coconut"]

# Set
# fruits = { "apple", "orange", "banana", "strawberry", "blueberry" "coconut" }

# Tuple
fruits = ("apple", "orange", "banana", "strawberry", "blueberry" "coconut")

# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)
    
for fruit in reversed(fruits):
    print(fruit)
