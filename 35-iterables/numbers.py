# Iterables
# # Iterables = An object/collection that can return its elements one at a time.
#                allowing it to be iterated over in a loop

# Lists can be reversed
# Sets can't be reversed
# Tuple can be reversed

# numbers = ["1","2","3","4","5"]

numbers = ("1","2","3","4","5")

# numbers = { "1","2","3","4","5" }


# for number in numbers:
#     print(number)
    

for number in reversed(numbers):
    print(number)
